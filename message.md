Structure/Logic inspiration
# 1. Consumers.py

## WebSocket Connection:

The game uses WebSockets for real-time communication. This is handled by the LobbyConsumer class in app/consumers.py.

Lobby Creation and Player Joining:

When a player creates or joins a lobby, they connect to the WebSocket.

The connect method in LobbyConsumer handles this initial connection.

## Game Initialization:

When all players are ready, the start_game method is called.

This method creates a GameState object and stores it in the lobby_to_gs dictionary.

## Tournament Structure:

If it's a tournament, a Tournament object is created in the start_game method.

The tournament manages the matches and player assignments.

## Game Loop:

The main game loop is handled by the run_matches method in LobbyConsumer.

It uses asyncio to run the matches asynchronously.

## Player Input:

Player inputs are received through the WebSocket in the receive method.

The key method updates the player's paddle state in the GameState.

## Game State Updates:

The GameState class (in app/game/game.py) handles the game logic.

It updates the ball position, checks for collisions, and manages scores.

## Sending Updates to Clients:

The game state is periodically sent to all connected clients using the WebSocket.

Methods like send_players_list, scene, etc., in LobbyConsumer handle this.

## Game End and Cleanup:

When a game or tournament ends, the end_game method is called.

It cleans up the game state and prepares for the next match if necessary.

## Key Asynchronous Concepts:

async def methods: These allow for asynchronous execution, crucial for handling multiple connections and game updates simultaneously.

await: Used to wait for asynchronous operations to complete without blocking the entire application.

asyncio.create_task: Used to create and run background tasks, like the game loop.

@database_sync_to_async: This decorator is used to make synchronous database operations asynchronous, preventing them from blocking the event loop.

## The flow generally works like this:

Players connect via WebSocket.

The game is initialized when all players are ready.

The game loop runs asynchronously, updating game state and sending updates to clients.

Player inputs are received and processed asynchronously.

The game continues until an end condition is met, then cleans up and potentially starts the next match.

This structure allows the server to handle multiple games simultaneously and provide real-time updates to all connected clients efficiently.

# 2. Tournament.py logic:
Tournament Initialization:

The __init__ method sets up the tournament structure based on the number of players and game type (2 or 4 players).

## Match Management:

get_match_count calculates the total number of matches needed.

get_match retrieves a specific match by its index.

## Tournament Start:

start_tournament creates all the necessary Match objects and assigns players to the initial matches.

## Player Assignment:

assign_player_positions is used to set up each individual match, assigning players to their positions in the GameState.

## Winner Handling:

set_match_winner records the winner of a match and triggers the assignment of players to future matches.

_assign_future_matches is an internal method that handles the logic of moving winners to their next matches.

The Tournament class acts as a manager for the entire tournament structure. It keeps track of all matches, handles player progression through the tournament, and interacts with the GameState to set up each individual match.

This class doesn't directly interact with the database or WebSocket connections. Instead, it's used by the LobbyConsumer to manage the overall flow of a tournament, determining which players should play in each match and how they progress through the rounds

# 3.  game.py:

The GameState class is the core of the game logic, managing players, ball, and game rules.

It uses asynchronous methods (async def) for operations that involve network communication or timing.

The game_loop method runs continuously, updating the game state and sending updates to clients.

Collision detection and handling are implemented in handle_collisions and related methods.

The get_scene method generates a representation of the game state that can be sent to clients.

# 4. views.py:

It defines Django view functions for different pages/endpoints (index, game, join).

The join function is the most complex, handling both GET and POST requests.

It includes extensive input validation for joining or creating a game lobby.

The views support both HTML rendering and JSON responses, depending on the request's Accept header.

Database operations are performed to create or retrieve Lobby objects.

The code uses Django's translation system for internationalization.

These views act as the entry points for the web application, handling HTTP requests and connecting the frontend to the game logic implemented in game.py. The join view, in particular, is crucial for setting up game lobbies before the WebSocket connection (handled by consumers.py) takes over for real-time game communication.
