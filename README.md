## Ways of working:
- Commit messages chould be in this format: `issue_number commit_message`, where commit_message follows [Conventional Commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- When creating a pull request, mention everyone and assign one person to review

## Architecture
### Game
- id
- player1
  - id
  - score
- player2
  - id
  - score
- state (PENDING, ONGOING, FINISHED)
- winner player
- timestamp(s)
#### Actions for Game:
- GET
- POST /games/ - Create game
    - Payload: {player1 id, player2 id}
- PUT /games/{gameId} - Update game
    - Payload: {player1 score, player2 score}
- PUT /games/{gameId} - Finish game

### Tournament
- id
- quarter1 (link to Game)
- quarter2
- quarter3
- quarter4

- semi2
- final
- name
- description
- state (PENDING, ONGOING, FINISHED)
- num_players (2,4,8)
- players (links to players)
- winner player

#### Actions for Tournament:
- GET
- POST /tournament - Create
- PUT /tournament/join Join
  - Payload: user id (or maybe none bc we have cookie?)

- Refresh tournament (when one of the games is finished, would probably be done from a websocket function but unsure)

### Player
- id
- username
